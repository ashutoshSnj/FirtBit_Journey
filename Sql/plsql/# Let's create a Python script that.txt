1. What is a stored procedure and how is it different from a function in SQL?
   Answer:
   A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements that can be executed as a unit. It can perform actions like modifying data or querying data.
   A function, on the other hand, is also a set of SQL statements but typically returns a single value and is used for calculations or returning results.
   - Stored Procedures: Can perform actions (e.g., modifying tables, inserting data).
   - Functions: Return a value, cannot modify database state directly.

2. How do you pass parameters to a stored procedure in SQL?
   Answer:
   To pass parameters to a stored procedure, you define them within the procedure declaration and pass the values when calling the procedure. For example:
   
   CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name(IN param_name INT)
   BEGIN
       -- SQL statements using param_name
   END;
   
   -- Here, param_name is the input parameter passed to the procedure.
   
3. How do you call a stored procedure in SQL with parameters?
   Answer:
   To call a stored procedure, you use the CALL statement with the arguments provided in the correct order. For example:
   
   CALL procedure_name(10);
   
   -- In this case, '10' is passed as the value for the input parameter.

4. How do you create a function in SQL that returns a value?
   Answer:
   A function in SQL is created using the CREATE FUNCTION statement, and it must return a value. For example:
   
   CREATE FUNCTION function_name(param_name INT)
   RETURNS INT
   BEGIN
       DECLARE result INT;
       SET result = param_name * 2;
       RETURN result;
   END;
   
   -- In this example, the parameter 'param_name' is passed to the function, and the function returns a value (the result of 'param_name * 2').

5. Can a function modify database tables or perform transactions in SQL?
   Answer:
   No, functions in SQL are designed to return a value and should not modify the database state (e.g., modifying tables, performing transactions). If you need to modify the database, you should use a stored procedure.
