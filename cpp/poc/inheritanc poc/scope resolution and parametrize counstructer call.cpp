	//When a derived class inherits from a base class in C++, it indeed inherits all the public and protected functions 
	//from the base class, including functions like display. 
	//However, if the derived class defines its own version of a function with the same name as in the base class, 
	//this function overrides the base class version for objects of the derived class.

   //Why Use Scope Resolution (::)?
//The scope resolution operator (::) is necessary when you want to call the base class version of an overridden function
// from within the derived class. Without it, calling the function name will invoke the derived classâ€™s version by default.
// The scope resolution operator tells the compiler explicitly that you want to use the base class version, 
//not the derived class version.


//derive class inherite all the function from base class but it not inherit counstructer
// the the solution is give the from derivel class counstructor to base class counstructer
